# Simple Snake Game (Turtle Module)

This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game, 
inspired by the original Nokia 3310 version. It’s a simple, 
single-player game where you control a snake, eat food to 
grow, and try not to hit the walls or your own tail!  This 
game utilizes the Python `turtle` module for graphics.

## Features

*   Classic Snake gameplay
*   Random food placement
*   Simple scoring
*   Collision detection (wall and self-collision)
*   Easy to play

## How to Play

1.  Run the game.
2.  Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
3.  Eat the food to grow longer.
4.  Avoid colliding with the walls or your own tail!

## Implementation Details

This game is built using Python and the `turtle` module for 
graphics. It's structured with a `Snake`, `Food`, and `Scoreboard` class to manage the game logic.

*   **Snake:** Represents the snake's body segments and 
movement.
*   **Food:** Generates random food positions on the turtle 
screen.
*   **Scoreboard:** Manages score change 
screen.
*   **main.py:** Manages the overall game state, including the 
snake, food, score, and collision detection.

## Getting Started

1.  **Ensure Python is installed:**  Make sure you have 
Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Run the game:**  Open a terminal or command prompt and 
navigate to the directory. Then, run the game 
using the command: `python snake_game.py`

## Controls

*   **Arrow Keys:** Move the 
Snake
    *   Up
    *   Down
    *   Left
    *   Right

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   Difficulty levels
*   Power-ups
*   Different food types
*   Level system
*   More advanced graphics (perhaps using a different 
graphics library)
